# Week_1_Challenge

## Project Overview
This project automates the process of analyzing a portfolio of loans. It includes calculations for summarizing the portfolio, determining the investment evaluation of individual loans, filtering out inexpensive loans, and exporting the filtered list to a CSV file. The automation is achieved through a series of Python scripts that perform various financial calculations and data processing tasks.

## Features
Loan Portfolio Summary: Calculates the total number of loans, the total value, and the average loan amount in a portfolio.\\
Investment Evaluation: Analyzes individual loans to calculate their present value and assesses whether they are worth the cost based on a minimum required return.\\
Financial Calculations: Includes a custom function to calculate the present value of a loan given its future value, remaining months, and annual discount rate.\\
Filtering Inexpensive Loans: Identifies loans in the portfolio that are less than or equal to $500.\\
Exporting Data: Outputs the list of inexpensive loans to a CSV file for further analysis or record-keeping.\\
